        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p class="text">This Privacy Policy explains how <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm.com</a>, Inc. (“Calm”, “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you access or use our websites, mobile application, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”), and when you contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.</p>

        <p class="text">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

        <h3>Collection of Information</h3>

        <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>

        <p class="text">We collect information when you register for an account, participate in interactive features (like submit a meditation rating), fill out a form or a survey, participate in a contest or promotion, make a purchase, communicate with us via social media sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The information you may provide includes your name, email, password, goals, previous meditation experience, street address, payment method information, feedback and survey responses, and other information about you included within your messages to us. Some users also provide health-related information in connection with providing feedback or other messages to us, and we process that information consistent with the purpose for which it was provided.</p>

        <h4>Other Information About Your Use of the Services</h4>

        <p class="text">When you use our Services, we collect the following information about you:</p>

          <li>Information we Generate: We generate some information about you based on other information we have collected. For example, like most platforms, we use your IP address to derive the approximate location of your device. We also use your first name to make an educated guess about your gender and use information about your activity to help determine the likelihood of you continuing to use our Services in the future (which we hope will be the case!).</li>
          <li>Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We use different technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons. Please see our Cookie Policy for more details: <a href="https://www.calm.com/cookies">https://www.calm.com/cookies</a></li>

        <h3>Information for California Residents</h3>

        <p class="text">This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (or “CCPA”).</p>

        <p class="text">In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as name, contact information and device identifiers), internet or other electronic network activity information (such as browsing behavior), approximate geolocation data, inferences (such as approximate location or product interests) and other personal information (such as payment method information, user credentials or health-related information). For more details about the personal information we collect, including the categories of sources, please see the “Collection of Information” section above.

        <p class="text">Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information, to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p>

        <p class="text">We do not “sell” the personal information we collect (and will not sell it in the future without providing a right to opt out).</p>

       <p class="text">California consumers may make a rights request by emailing us at support@calm.com We will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.</p>
